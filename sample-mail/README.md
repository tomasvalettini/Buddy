# Mail sample
This sample mimics a mail client. It's not a real mail client, there is no POP3 or IMAP Server behind it.
All the data is randomly generated on app start. There is no persistent layer like local database on the device. The APK file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby/releases/download/1.1.0/sample-mail.apk).

**Important:** This sample project uses annotation processors. If you import this sample into android studio, you may have to run `Build --> Rebuild Project` manually to ensure that all annotation processors have generated code.
